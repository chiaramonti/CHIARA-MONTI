<h1>Methodology</h1>

<p>This second section is devoted to a <strong>detailed explanation of the methodology</strong> adopted throughout the project.</p>

<p>As an initial step, we identified a clearly defined area of focus that aligned with our research interests. For the purposes of this study, we chose to concentrate on <strong>Archaeological Sites</strong> (as already mentioned in the home page), given their historical significance and relevance within the broader context of cultural heritage.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we began our research within the ArCo dataset by designing and executing the following <strong>SPARQL queries</strong>.</p>

      The query retrieves up to 100 cultural properties that are labeled as “parco archeologico”, 
      along with their labels and any available images, sorted alphabetically by name. <br><br>
      However, the results of this query were too general for our investigation, so we decided to formulate another query that investigated the class <strong>ArchaeologicalParks</strong>.<br><br>

      Thanks to the approach we adopted, the expected results were achieved. At this point, we decided to focus the research on a selection of Italian regions. We began by investigating Sicily and Sardinia, as we found it particularly interesting to conduct a study on Italy’s major islands.<br><br>

  Subsequently, in order to enrich the data related to the archaeological parks we had selected, we decided to consult <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, which provided us with the following response. To formulate this question, we employed the <strong>zero-shot prompting</strong> technique.
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">

    By reviewing the results provided by ChatGPT and comparing them with the information already available in the ArCo database regarding the archaeological parks we selected, we have decided to add <strong>three new triples</strong>—currently missing—for each park.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>first triple</strong> concerns the precise geographical coordinates of the selected archaeological parks, expressed in terms of latitude and longitude. For this, we will use the predicate <strong><em>geo:lat/geo:long</em></strong>, already present in ArCo.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>second triple</strong> refers to the conservation status of the parks, a fundamental aspect in this context. We will introduce new triples using the ArCo predicate <strong><em>a-dd:hasConservationStatus</em></strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>third triple</strong> we propose involves introducing links to equivalent entities in external datasets. We have chosen to work with <strong>Wikidata</strong>. This new triple will use the predicate <strong><em>owl:sameAs</em></strong>, which is also already included in ArCo.
  </p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 50px;">

<p><strong>RESEARCH FOR THE FIRST TRIPLE</strong><p>
    
<p>Regarding the insertion of the first triple, we first verified that the predicate <strong>geo:lat / geo:long</strong> provided by ChatGPT was indeed the same one used in ARCO.After conducting some checks, we confirmed that the LLM was providing accurate information. Therefore, in order to propose this triple, <strong>we asked both LLMs</strong> to provide us with the <strong>precise geographic coordinates</strong>. In this case, we decided to use the <strong>zero-shot prompting tecnique.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Evaluation of the answers:</strong> In this instance, it is important to note how the two LLMs provide <strong>differing responses concerning the Parco archeologico di Saturo</strong>. Consequently, it was necessary to <strong>conduct further internet research</strong> to ascertain which of the two classifications might be more appropriate for the Parco archeologico di Saturo. Regarding other aspects of the responses, both were highly exhaustive, even reporting whether restoration work had been carried out.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <strong>ChatGPT</strong> also provided information regarding the <strong>sources</strong> from which it retrieved the data (although this was not requested), whereas Gemini did not.</p>

<p>It is now necessary to focus on <strong>determining the conservation status of the Parco archeologico di Saturo.</strong>

<p>For this reason, we decided to <strong>directly query LLMs</strong> to thoroughly analyze the main factors influencing the conservation status of archaeological parks. Consequently, we opted to employ a <strong>chain-of-thought prompting</strong> approach, which we present below.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>

<p><strong>What are the main factors that influence the state of conservation of archaeological parks? Start by identifying natural and environmental risks (such as erosion, pollution, and climate change), then consider the impact of human activities (tourism, urban development, and vandalism), and finally explore the conservation and management strategies adopted to protect these sites. Please just consider the Parco Archeologico di Saturo in Apulia, Italy.</strong></p>

	 Here is a detailed analysis of the main factors influencing the state of conservation of the Parco Archeologico di Saturo (Leporano, Apulia), structured by category:

      <p><strong>1. Natural and Environmental Risks</strong></p>
      <p><strong>-Coastal and atmospheric erosion:</strong>The park is located on a coastal promontory exposed to wind, rain, and sea spray. These factors contribute to the deterioration of archaeological structures, stone walls, and mosaics.</p>
      <p><strong>-Mediterranean climate and climate change:</strong>Increased temperature fluctuations, droughts, and heavy rainfall linked to climate change accelerate material decay, especially in stone and mortar. They also promote the growth of invasive vegetation and water infiltration.</p>
      <p><strong>-Invasive vegetation and wildfires:</strong> Uncontrolled dry grasses and shrubs can physically damage structures and significantly raise the risk of fire, especially during the summer months.</p>
	  
      <p><strong>2. Impact of Human Activities</strong></p>
      <p><strong>-Tourism and guided visits:</strong> While tourism is essential for awareness and funding, excessive or unregulated foot traffic can cause erosion of paths, degradation of mosaics, and general wear of ancient remains. Since 2006, visits have been managed by the local cooperative PoliSviluppo, but infrastructure remains limited.</p>
      <p><strong>-Urban development and nearby infrastructure</strong>: Surrounding buildings, old bunkers, and nearby recreational structures (like bars and picnic areas) create visual and environmental disturbances and risk altering the archaeological context.</p>
      <p><strong>-Vandalism and neglect:</strong> In recent years, several reports have highlighted neglect, including overgrown vegetation, lack of signage, and minimal maintenance—factors that facilitate further damage and discourage public interest.</p>

      <p><strong>3. Conservation and Management Strategies</strong></p>
      <p><strong>-Structural restoration and infrastructure projects:</strong> Recent interventions (2018–2021) have included efforts to restore and consolidate certain sections of the site, particularly the Greek and Roman phases of the settlement, the sanctuary, and the cisterns.</p>
      <p><strong>-Vegetation control:</strong> Maintenance plans include regular mowing and clearing of invasive plants, though consistency and funding remain challenges.</p>
      <p><strong>-Cultural enhancement and awareness:</strong> Educational initiatives, archaeological workshops, and guided tours aim to raise awareness of the site’s historical value and foster a sense of community responsibility.</p>
      <p><strong>-Collaboration with local institutions:</strong> The Municipality of Leporano, in partnership with the Superintendence and regional cultural bodies, continues to promote the park through seasonal events and funding proposals.</p>
      
	  <p>In summary, the conservation of the Parco Archeologico di Saturo is challenged by both natural forces—especially erosion and climate—and by human pressures such as unmanaged tourism and insufficient maintenance. However, ongoing restoration efforts, community involvement, and educational outreach offer a promising framework for its long-term protection.</p>

    The Archaeological Park of Saturo in Apulia, Italy, is a historical site facing several conservation challenges, stemming from both natural factors and human activity.
     <p><strong>Natural and Environmental Risks</strong></p>
     <p>Its coastal location makes it particularly vulnerable to marine erosion, which can destroy exposed archaeological layers. Climate change poses a long-term threat, with rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and sea-level rise all potentially damaging the site. While not always specifically detailed for Saturo, pollution is also a general risk for archaeological sites, potentially compromising material preservation.</p>
     <p><strong>Impact of Human Activities</strong></p>
     <p>Tourism, though vital, can cause physical wear and tear and microclimatic alterations if not properly managed. Uncontrolled urban development in the area surrounding the park has already encroached upon and destroyed archaeological deposits, altering the landscape. Finally, vandalism, including graffiti, looting, and illegal excavations, directly threatens the archaeological heritage.</p>
	 <p><strong>Conservation and Management Strategies</strong></p>
     <p>To protect the park, several strategies are essential: constant monitoring of the site's conditions, preventive conservation (e.g., drainage systems and vegetation control), and restoration and stabilization of damaged structures. Visitor management through defined paths and signage is crucial to minimize impact. Collaboration among various entities, securing funding (including European funds), and strict enforcement of laws are all vital to ensure the long-term protection of the Archaeological Park of Saturo.</p>

	<strong>Evaluation:</strong> It can be observed that ChatGPT provided a much more structured response, articulated across multiple main points with several sub-points for each. The length of the response indicates both accuracy and precision. 
</td>
    <td>
    <strong>Evaluation:</strong> Unlike the other LLM, this one provided a less schematic and more discursive response. This isn't synonymous with inaccuracy, and it's still a good outcome, equivalent to ChatGPT's. The information it provides is certainly less, but it's still sufficient for what we wanted to know.

<p style="margin-top: 10px;">
<p>However, our objective was to <strong>ascertain the definitive conservation status</strong> to propose. Consequently, we formulated an additional specific inquiry.
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p><strong>So how would you describe its conservation status? BadConservationStatus or MediocreConservationStatus?</strong></p>

<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ChatGPT</th>
    <th>Gemini</th>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
	 Why not "BadConservationStatus"?

      <p><strong>-The site is accessible</strong> and regularly visited through guided tours.</p>
      <p><strong>-Restoration efforts have taken place</strong> especially between 2018 and 2021, targeting structural elements and improving signage.</p>
      <p>-There is a <strong>local cooperative (PoliSviluppo)</strong> that promotes educational activities and basic maintenance.</p>
	  
      <p>But it’s not in “Good” condition either, because:</p>
      <p><strong>-Maintenance is inconsistent,</strong> with recurring issues like overgrown vegetation and lack of cleanliness.</p>
      <p><strong>-Infrastructural support is minimal</strong>—facilities are limited, and parts of the site appear neglected.</p>
      <p><strong>-Exposure to erosion, climate events, and occasional vandalism</strong> continue to threaten the preservation of archaeological materials.</p>
      
	  <p><strong>MediocreConservationStatus</strong> accurately reflects the site's condition: it is not abandoned or severely degraded, but it lacks the stable protection, continuous care, and infrastructure needed for long-term, sustainable conservation.</p>
</td>
<td>
    Given its history of significant damage (especially from abusive urbanization) and constant natural threats like marine erosion and climate change, the conservation status of the Archaeological Park of Saturo can be described as <strong>MediocreConservationStatus.</strong>
     <p>Despite these challenges, active and funded efforts are underway for the site's restoration, management, and valorization. This prevents classifying it as "BadConservationStatus," which would imply a lack of intervention. However, the inherent vulnerabilities and past damages keep it from achieving a "GoodConservationStatus."</p>
     <p>Its coastal location makes it particularly vulnerable to marine erosion, which can destroy exposed archaeological layers. Climate change poses a long-term threat, with rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and sea-level rise all potentially damaging the site. While not always specifically detailed for Saturo, pollution is also a general risk for archaeological sites, potentially compromising material preservation.</p>

<p>Now, let us analyze the responses for the other three archaeological parks from the two LLMs.</p>

<p><strong>Benedetta's question to ChatGPT and Gemini</strong>: </p>
 
 <p><strong>I am trying to enrich ArCo, also known as, Architettura della Conoscenza regarding the conservation status of archaeological sites.

<p><strong>Evaluation of the answers:</strong>Firstly, this time we observe an <strong>exact correspondence</strong> regarding the <strong>conservation status</strong> provided by both LLMs.</p> 

<p>Furthermore, <strong>ChatGPT</strong> chose to segment its responses by including <strong>helpful subheadings</strong> (for the last two parks).  <strong>Gemini</strong>, in turn, described all the parks with comparable <strong>attention to detail</strong>.</p> 

<p>In this instance, <strong>the responses from both ChatGPT and Gemini are exhaustive and meticulously crafted.</strong><p>

<p><strong>RESEARCH FOR THE THIRD TRIPLE</strong><p>

<p>Regarding the third triple, our aim was to insert a <strong>link connecting our ArCo resource to an equivalent or nearly equivalent resource on Wikidata</strong>.</p>

<p>In this instance, to determine the appropriate predicate, we used the answer of the <strong>initial zero-shot prompting with ChatGPT</strong>, which suggested <strong>owl:sameAs</strong>, a predicate already existing in ArCo.</p>
	
<p>To achieve this, we searched for the names of the archaeological parks selected for our research within <strong>Wikidata's search bar</strong>. Unfortunately, the <strong>Parco archeologico di Canne della Battaglia</strong> was the only park for which we found <strong>no corresponding entry</strong> whatsoever on Wikidata; therefore, it will not be included in the proposed triples in this instance.<p>

<p>In this manner, we were able to <strong>link two equivalent resources present in two different databases through a single triple</strong>. Useful data concerning the archaeological parks are embedded within these links.</p>
