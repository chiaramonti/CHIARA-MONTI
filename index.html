    Good morning! We are <strong>Ghirotti Benedetta</strong> and <strong>Monti Chiara</strong>, students of <em>Language Society and Communication</em> at the University of Bologna. The aim of our project was to explore the <strong>ArCo dataset</strong> in order to enrich the information related to archaeological parks, which served as the topic of interest for our research.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Italian ArCo database served as the foundation for our project, which seeks to enrich and expand its coverage. Our attention was directed specifically toward <strong>archaeological parks across Italy</strong>, exploring their historical, cultural, and architectural relevance. These sites are essential in preserving national heritage and provide a vital resource for academic research into ancient civilizations, urban planning, and societal development.
  </p>

  <p>
    To evaluate how comprehensively ArCo classifies these archaeological parks, we designed a series of <strong>SPARQL queries</strong> to rigorously interrogate the dataset.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this evaluation, several omissions and areas lacking in detail became apparent. In response, we employed <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> to enhance our understanding of the subject. Insights generated by the LLMs (ChatGPT and Gemini) were subsequently converted into new triples, enriching the ArCo database with more nuanced and comprehensive information.
  </p>
<p>The project was conducted with a <strong>collaborative and coordinated approach</strong>, ensuring a comprehensive understanding across all phases and strategically organized efforts. Joint reviews guaranteed <strong>coherence and a shared, in-depth comprehension</strong> of the overall process.
  </p>
  
<p>Initially, <strong>collective decision-making for the topic proved challenging</strong> due to extensive existing documentation in the ARCO knowledge base, leading to a pivot toward <strong>archaeological parks</strong>.
</p>

<p>Analyzing available ARCO data allowed us to <strong>identify key areas for enrichment.</strong> This exploratory phase was followed by complementary and coordinated work on both content and technical structure, culminating in a <strong>cohesive and effective final product</strong> fully aligned with our initial goals.
</p>
