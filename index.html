    Good morning! We are <strong>Ghirotti Benedetta</strong> and <strong>Monti Chiara</strong>, students of <em>Language Society and Communication</em> at the University of Bologna. The aim of our project was to explore the <strong>ArCo dataset</strong> in order to enrich the information related to archaeological parks, which served as the topic of interest for our research.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Italian ArCo database served as the foundation for our project, which seeks to enrich and expand its coverage. Our attention was directed specifically toward <strong>archaeological parks across Italy</strong>, exploring their historical, cultural, and architectural relevance. These sites are essential in preserving national heritage and provide a vital resource for academic research into ancient civilizations, urban planning, and societal development.
  </p>

  <p>
    To evaluate how comprehensively ArCo classifies these archaeological parks, we designed a series of <strong>SPARQL queries</strong> and employed diverse <strong>prompting techniques</strong> designed to rigorously interrogate the dataset.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this evaluation, several omissions and areas lacking in detail became apparent. In response, we employed <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> to enhance our understanding of the subject. Insights generated by the LLMs (ChatGPT and Gemini) were subsequently converted into new triples, enriching the ArCo database with more nuanced and comprehensive information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Further details on our methodology and findings can be accessed through the <strong>dropdown menu</strong> provided at the top of this page.
